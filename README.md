# Personal Portfolio Website

I wanted to create a multifunctional website that would initially serve as a portfolio website. I would like a potential customer or employer to get a general idea of me, my skills and experience in one place.

## Description

I thought it would be best to have a dynamic blog attached to the site where I can add further projects, instead of having multiple links to different domains. I just need to link to the project related blog posts from the 'Project' section on the main one page scroller. The blog has a secure authenticated login with cookie based private routing authorization to add, delete and edit blog posts. The marked module was used to have a bit more control over the styling. The portfolio, work and about sections are part of a one page scroller, making it very simple to navigate and easy to find information. Part of the reason to create the portfolio site was to practically implement the technology that I'm currently learning, being Node.js and Vanilla JavaScript.

## Built With
* Express - server and routing
* MongoDB - to save app data and blog posts
* EJS - templating engine
